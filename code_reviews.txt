Some key similarities between Yelp and Microsoft code reviewer guidelines are that they prioritize test coverage and code readability. Yelp focuses on easy quick feedback, test coverage for all cases, and clear communication while Microsoft also focuses on these main functions while also being able to respond to all feedback. There are some key differences between the two in terms of code reviewer guidelines, Yelp has a focus on collaboration and effective quick communication while Microsoft uses emoji code to emphasize the tone in which the feedback is given. Microsoft uses automation of reviews to let users focus on more complex problems as opposed to simple problems such as style. On the other hand, Yelp has a major focus on making sure that the code is correct and efficient in all regards.
The Apple code reviewer guidelines are a great example of a good code review. Throughout the guidelines, it is easy to understand the specifics in terms of how to collaborate with others and does a really good job of covering all aspects of code. The Apple code reviewer guidelines also do a great job of communicating how to be respectful of the work from other contributors while clearly displaying all rules and regulations.

An example of a bad code reviewer guideline is the GitLab guidelines. Although nicely organized, it seems as if GitLab does not prioritize a positive environment in terms of collaboration as not much detail has been listed about it. It also seems as if not all basis of code are covered within the reviewer guidelines. A way to improve the GitLab code reviewer guidelines is to add additional information about all aspects of code as well as foster a positive collaboration environment.
